# Battleship OOP
Battleship is a classic guessing game for two players that has been implemented using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game is played on a grid where each player's fleet of ships is placed in secret locations. Players take turns calling out shots at the other player's grid in an attempt to destroy their ships. The game ends when one player has destroyed all of the other player's ships.

## Installation
To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run the main Battleship class.
4. Game is running in terminal

## Usage
When the game is running, you will be prompted to enter your name and choose whether to manually place your ships or place them randomly. After each player has placed their ships, the game will start and players will take turns calling out shots at the other player's grid.

To take a shot, enter the coordinates of the cell you want to target in the format of letter + number. For example, A1 would target the cell in the first row and first column.

After each shot, the game will tell you whether it was a hit, miss, or sunk. A ship is considered sunk when all of its cells have been hit. The game will continue until one player has destroyed all of the other player's ships.
